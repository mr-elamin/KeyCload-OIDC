# OpenID-Connect Integration with Keycloak IAM

## Overview

This project aims to integrate an application client with Keycloak Identity and Authorization Management (IAM) using the OpenID-Client library for Node.js, Authlib for Python, or IdentityModel for C#. The goal is to provide a secure and efficient way to manage user authentication and authorization across various programming languages and frameworks.

## Project Description

I have been working on this project for somedays, focusing on connecting an application client to Keycloak using the OpenID-Client library. However, I have encountered some challenges and would appreciate any help or collaboration from those interested in learning something new or who have experience with OpenID-Client and Keycloak.

## Keycloak IAM

Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Authorization Management System (IAM) that provides APIs to work with various programming languages. It offers a comprehensive solution for managing user authentication, authorization, and identity management for your applications.

## OpenID-Client

The OpenID-Client library is a certified OpenID Connect (OIDC) Relying Party (RP) implementation for Node.js. It allows you to connect your application to an OIDC provider, such as Keycloak, to handle user authentication and authorization.

## authlib

Authlib is a comprehensive library for OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect in Python. It provides tools to help you integrate your Python applications with OAuth and OpenID Connect providers.

## IdentityModel

IdentityModel is a library for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect in .NET. It provides tools to help you integrate your C# applications with OAuth and OpenID Connect providers.

## Getting Started
